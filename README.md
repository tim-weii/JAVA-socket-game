##  Project Overview  
This project was developed as the **final assignment** for the *Network Programming* course.  
It is a **multiplayer real-time bomb game** implemented in **Java** using **Socket programming**.  

The game focuses on **real-time synchronization** between multiple players, handling state updates such as movement, collisions, and health across different clients.  
Key challenges include:  
- Ensuring **low-latency synchronization** over sockets  
- Handling **multi-threading** for concurrent player actions  
- Managing **game events** (bomb explosion, health deduction, player elimination)  

Despite the difficulties, the system successfully supports **up to 10 players** playing simultaneously with real-time interactions.  

---

##  Gameplay Rules  
- Use **Arrow Keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí)** to control movement.  
- Combine directions (e.g., ‚Üë + ‚Üí) to move diagonally.  
- Colliding with a **bomb** deducts **20 HP**.  
- Each player starts with **100 HP** ‚Üí hit **5 times** = eliminated.

## ‚öô Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Networking:** Socket (TCP)  
- **Concurrency:** Multi-threading for client-server communication  
- **Game Logic:** Collision detection, health management, player state synchronization  

---

##  Outcome  
- Successfully deployed a **real-time multiplayer game** supporting 10 concurrent players.  
- Implemented **synchronized gameplay** with socket-based communication.  
- Learned deeply about **sockets, threading, synchronization, and latency handling** in real-time systems.  
- More than just a course project ‚Äî finishing it felt like survival rather than just achievement!
